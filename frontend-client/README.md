# Hello, World!

_Hello, World!_ is a single-page app where you can meet with others for a one-on-one video call with live captions translated for your co-participant in their preferred language.

# Purpose

This app was originally designed to make digital health appointments more linguistically accessible. As such, only the 'Health' option on the homepage is functional. Nevertheless, we quickly learned that the functionality of live translated captions could be useful in virtually any situation where users might meet over a video call. Thus, we decided to name the app with a universal title, _Hello, World!_ since it could be used for any video-based virtual interaction.
